# Scaffolds

Scaffolds for javascript projects.

There are a lot of excellent scaffolds for javascript projects. Most of them
attempt to provide out of box experience and a lot of customizable options via
simple cli commands. But for a real world project, they are somewhat unpleasant.
Usually we need to read large documents to understand how they work and inevitably
need to understand their underlying dependencies like babel and webpack.

This repository mostly aims to collect some frequently used configs in the form of
templates. To use them, we just need copy and paste, and can control as will easily.
